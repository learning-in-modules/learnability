Learnability and the Dynamic Textbook
=====================================

The way information is organized has a tremendous impact on the way it is interpreted. The context of how you discover a document may determine your reaction even more than the document itself. Going along with that, different ways of organizing documents produce different reactions, and make different things easy and hard. For example, the web makes it easy to hop between different web pages, but it makes it hard to create long-form writing, encouraging a more serial style.  The novel does the opposite, enabling long, uninterrupted passages.  Scientific papers make a web of verifiability while allowing experts to remain abreast of the latest developments, at the cost of making it extremely difficult to learn directly from reading scientific papers.

So here's a rough outline of my talk.  First, I'm going to talk about the _metainformation structure_ of a system of documents.  If you've heard of metadata, metainformation is essentially the same concept.  It doesn't have anything to do with the actual content of a piece of writing, it just contains information about how this piece of writing is related to other pieces of writing.  Hyperlinks and Footnotes are examples of a metainformation structure, creating connections between documents without adding any content.

Some of these metainformation structures have been explicitly constucted, the most famous example probably being HTML and the internet, which Tim Berners-Lee designed to promote sharing ideas.  

Right now, if you wanted to learn something, you would have to know where to find it.  You might spend some time searching the internet or libraries for a resource that might not even exist.  Over time, if you do not give up out of frustration, you would get a better idea of where the information lived.  It would become easier and easier for you to find whatever information you need.

When you're searching the internet, or scientific paper archives, or any other store of information, you are always navigation a constructed metainformation structure.  This specifies the relationships between different documents within the genre.  Some information structures are created implicitly, without any design, like intertext allusions in novels.  Another metainformation structure is the web of references in scientific papers.

Different metainformation structures make some things easy and some things difficult.  For example, the structure of the web of scientific papers makes it easy for experts to quickly and concisely learn about new discoveries.  Papers are explicitly connected by *citations*, which invoke the results of a previous paper.  If the reader needs a refresher, or simply hasn't seen the referred paper, she can look up the cited paper to bring herself up to speed.  Papers which are cited often are considered more important, since they _demonstrably_ reach conclusions which further papers elaborate on.  Furthermore, once a scientist has seen many papers, she will be able to know a large amount about a paper without even reading it, just by seeing which papers it cites.

Simultaneously, the specifics of
