Learnability and the Dynamic Textbook
=====================================

**write a real introduction**

Right now, if you wanted to learn something, 
you would have to know where to find it.
You might spend some time searching the internet
or libraries for a resource that might not even
exist.  
Over time, if you do not give up out of frustration,
you would get a better idea of where the information
lived.  
It would become easier and easier for you
to find whatever information you need.
