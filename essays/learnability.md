Learnability and the Dynamic Textbook
=====================================

**Write a real introduction**

Right now, if you wanted to learn something, you would have to know where to find it.  You might spend some time searching the internet or libraries for a resource that might not even exist.  Over time, if you do not give up out of frustration, you would get a better idea of where the information lived.  It would become easier and easier for you to find whatever information you need.

When you're searching the internet, or scientific paper archives, or any other store of information, you are always navigation a constructed metainformation structure.  This specifies the relationships between different documents within the genre.  Some information structures are created implicitly, without any design, like intertext allusions in novels.  Another metainformation structure is the web of references in scientific papers.

Different metainformation structures make some things easy and some things difficult.
